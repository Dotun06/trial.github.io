						<p>This is my first chromebook,although not my first laptop.</p>
						<p>My first laptop kinda crashed few weeks after my mum gave me.</p>
						<p>That laptop was a windows and this chromebook is obviously runs on Chrome Os</p>
						<p>I really wish i got a laptop which runs on windows Os but it's fine. I'll just adapt.</p>
						<h2>Story about myself.</h2>

						<p>You are probably wondering why I only said my mum, like every child has a father, yeah but,you'll hear the story of my father later.</p>
